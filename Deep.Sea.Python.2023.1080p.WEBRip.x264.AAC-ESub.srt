Professor Zhong is dead

25
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,541
You want to make his death worthwhile

26
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:20,666
You talk nonsense

27
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,791
He's not dead

28
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,041
Get out of here

29
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,875
We still have many projects to do

30
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,041
Let's go Let's go

31
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,666
Don't give me the eggs

32
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,666

A country in Southeast Asia

What's the matter?

38
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,041
Please speak straight

39
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,791
I just want to care about your recent progress

40
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,500
The sea area now has strong electromagnetic interference

41
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,791
Not even the satellite can detect

42
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,291
I've been there more than ten times this time

43
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,875
It is still being explored

44
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,291
I've heard that a dozen times

45
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,041
As long as I find the island

46
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,416
Can get what you want

47
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,041

I'll let you know as soon as I have news

49
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,541
That's no progress

50
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,791
I've invested a lot of energy in you these years

51
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,916
Ask for money

52
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,291
Give to others

53
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,125
You didn't give me anything

54
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,041
If you feel unworthy

55
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,041
We can terminate the cooperation at any time

56
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,166
just

57
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,291
Don't regret it

58
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,166
I didn't mean that

59
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,916
I just want an explanation

60
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,416
Explain what

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I made it You can get it

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,375
Ten times a hundred times a thousand times a thousand times a return

63
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,750
I crawled back from there

64
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,041
Only I can get what you want

65
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:24,875
Is it?

66
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:29,791

I don't see what I shouldn't see

69
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,375
I don't listen to what I shouldn't listen to

70

Just follow them

180
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,041
Do you have any cigarettes

181
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:51,791
Go and prepare

182
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,166
good

183
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,375
This time

184
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,916
I must find it

185
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,416
Why did you go to that island

186
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,416
Very dangerous

187
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,041
I want to write a book about desert island exploration

188
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,416
The mysterious nameless island

189
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,916
It is said that since the era of great navigation

190
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,791
The last virgin land of mankind

191
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,166
Let me tell you

192
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,000
Only my brother can find it in the world

193
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,416
This photo is beautiful enough

194
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,000
It's heaven on earth

195
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,791
I don't care what you do

196
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,166
You can't lose a penny

197
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,166
My pony is not ready yet

198
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,541
Mingming

199
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:48,916
Wait for Mom and Dad to come back

200
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,291
How about making a whole zoo for you

201
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,041
good

202
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,041
Then I'll wait for you to come back

203
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,291
Dad and Mom

204
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,041
Dad and Mom

205
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,791
Dad and Mom

206
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,250
this

207
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,916
It's low-pressure cavitation

208
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,375
Everybody hold steady

209
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,041
Put on your life jacket

210
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,625
Are we in danger

211
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,041
meeting

212
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,375
fat person

213
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,625
Tie the rope

214
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,416
Aren't you going to Senna Island

215
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,541
Hold fast

216
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,666
Let's cut in now

217
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:16,875
fat person

218
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,875
fat person fat person

219
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,291
fat person fat person

220
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,041
Zhong Ming

221
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,291
Zhong Ming

222
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,041
are you all right?

223
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,166
how

224
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,500
Summer lotus summer lotus

225
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,666
Summer lotus

226
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,375
Summer lotus

227
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,541
Help!

228
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,791
There's a ghost

229
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,416
Summer lotus

230
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:58,666
are you all right?

231
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,791
Skull crab is just a kind of hermit crab

232
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,791
Where is this

233
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:13,916
Senna Island

234
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,375
This is where you are looking

235
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,791
Since the ship is gone

236
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,041
We can only go to the island first

237
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,541
Have you thought about how to go back

238
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,041
Still on the island

239
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,791
Isn't life like this

240
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,541
No worst

241
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,416
Only worse

242
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,291
It's not good to follow you

243
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,291
No matter what, let's go

244
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,416
What's up?

245
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,500
It's okay Let's go

246
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,166
What's that noise?

247
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,375
voice

248
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,250
No, no sound

249
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,666
There's no sound Let's go

250
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,666
How can there be crying

251
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:39,916
over there

252
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:43,666
Zhong Ming

253
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:44,916
Wait for me

254
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,416
Don't be impulsive

255
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,125
look out

256
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,791
Be careful

257
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:56,375
Slow down

258
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,166
I will

259
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:26,625
fat person

260
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:29,666
fat person

261
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,291
Save me Chen Yue

262
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,625
Don't move Don't move

263
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:34,791
What now?

264
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:35,541
This is Guiwaicao

265
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,875
The bigger you move, the faster it sinks

266
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,416
Don't move Don't come

267
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,166
Do something

268
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,916
What to do

269
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,416
Don't move. I'll save you

270
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,166
What are you doing?

271
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,666
Get out of here

272
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,250
Chen Yue

273
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,791
Is there something wrong with you

274
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:50,916
Chen Yue

275
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,291
I don't need you to save me

276
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,166
I won't let you save me even if I die

277
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:55,666
screw you

278
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,500
Go away, Chen Yue

279
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,291
Wipe

280
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,041
get out of here

281
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,291
I need you to save me in this way

282
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:07,791
Then I was thinking

283
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,791
You stay away from me

284
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,375
You give this to him

285
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:09,875
what the hell

286
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,500
Get out of here

287
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,541
I really can't pee on you

288
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,750
I don't want to hear this word

289
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,125
Don't talk about it. Don't talk about it

290
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,416
The main reason is that ghosts cry and grass are afraid of water

291
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,791
I really can't do what you want me to do

292
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:25,791
water Chen Yue

293
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:26,666
Chen Yue

294
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,416
This is mainly

295
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,291
It's too late to ask

296
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,666
It's too late I'm too late

297
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,041
You're too late You

298
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,541
Stop me. Who is too late

299
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,666
It's you

300
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,500
You can't make it I can't make it

301
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,500
I won't allow you to mention this matter again

302
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,041
I don't want you to mention

303
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,875
I can finally wash it off

304
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,666
You insulted me

305
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,291
fat person

306
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,916
What are you doing

307
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,041
come

308
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,166
Drink some water

309
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:33,916
Don't drink

310
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,916
It's been half a day. We're worried about you. Have a drink

311
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,666
Don't drink and take away

312
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,166
Let me wash your feet

313
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,000
Come on, you

314
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,125
Hate

315
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:12,875
You seem to have something on your mind

316
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,916
Not at all

317
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,916
I think you have something on your mind

318
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,541
What can I worry about

319
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,125
Drink more water

320
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,750
Ladies first

321
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:38,666
What are you look at?

322
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,416
I didn't pee in

323
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:44,791
what is it?

324
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,041
this

325
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,666
This is a kind of fruit shell

326
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,125
It's eggshell

327
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:01,916
Wait for me here

328
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,666
Zhong Ming

329
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,375
look out

330
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,250
Are you looking for this

331
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,791
Thank you

332
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,875
It's important to you

333
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,125
Let's go

334
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:58,500

Here you are

341
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,166
How did you come

342
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,250
See the mark I left for you

343
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,750
Didn't you wait

344
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,291
It's not Boss Shen and him

345
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:12,666
The examiners are very enthusiastic

346
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,166
Let me introduce you

347
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,541

Come, come, Zhong Ming

00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:29,250
Let's eat first, and then there's more

351
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:32,791
Hurry up the barbecue

352
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:33,416
good

353
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,375
Put less pepper

354
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,166
Eat more

355
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,916
Come and touch one

356
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:43,916
Come Zhong Ming

357
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:44,541
welcome

358
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:47,125
Come and touch one

359
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,166
come

360
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,041
come

361
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:00,250
drink

362
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:02,916
let me have a look

363
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,291
So you are here to explore

364
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:14,375
How brave, young and promising

365
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,166
Our ship sank

366
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,041
If Boss Shen hadn't met you

367
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,291
This time we're all screwed

368
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,166
This island is really unsafe

369
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:27,791
We take care of each other together

370
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:29,375
When I finish my exams

371
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:32,041
How about you take my boat back together

372
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,416
I don't know what kind of scientific examination you do

373
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,541
Company secrets are not easy to disclose

374
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,791
I don't think we need to bother

375
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:44,375
We have something else to do

376
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:45,875
Don't bother

377
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:46,791
Don't Don't

378
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,541
Let's talk about it later

379
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,875
Sit, sit, sit

380
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,291
Now

381
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,166
The most important thing is to eat and fill your stomach

382
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:54,041
Yeah, yeah

383
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,875
You must have a full stomach before doing anything

384
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:56,875
Come, come, come

385
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:58,666
Come on, young man

386
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:02,166
Eat more

387
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:15,791
You

388
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,291
Go to the island in advance

389
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:20,666
Have you found anything strange

390
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,750
How do you know

391
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,291
We are the first to go to the island

392
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:33,625
He and she

393
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:34,791
They both told me

394
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:37,041
Yeah, that

395
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,791
Boss Shen, take it easy

396
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,041
This island is very evil

397
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,416
I was almost strangled by that grass

398
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,041
Right

399
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,541
We saw it together

400
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,666
A super large coconut shell

401
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:57,291
Old age

402
00:27:58,291 --> 00:27:59,916
It's too late to stay up

403
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:03,000
Then you should rest early

404
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:06,916
You have to leave after dawn tomorrow

405
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,375
Not safe at night

406
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:10,500
Excuse me

407
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:13,791
good night

408
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,416
They have no value

409
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,041
Understand

410
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,166
Shh

411
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:37,791
Only I know this route

412
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,541
No one else can get there

413
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:40,791
They came secretly

414
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:42,750
There must be an ulterior purpose

415
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,041
We must leave at once

416
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,000
good

417
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,416
Go and call Xia He

418
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:47,791
My name is Fatty

419
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:53,791
step on it

420
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:55,000
Where should I take it out

421
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,625
frence leave

422
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:10,375
It's not polite

423
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,125
right back at you

424
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,791
You are also on guard

425
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,916
Since we have lost trust

426
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,250
that

427
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:25,541
Boss Shen, don't be impulsive

428
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:26,541
Let me explain to you

429
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:29,375
My friend is used to going alone

430
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:32,666
So suddenly we have so many people that he is not used to it

431
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:37,541
Chen Yue

432
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,666
not bad

433
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:42,666
I'm looking for you

434
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,666
Although I didn't catch your boat

435
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:50,416
Fortunately, I followed your route

436
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,791
I have to admire you

437
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:57,750
Can think of

438
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,416
The island is hidden in the eye of the storm

439
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,916
It's just that you have no value now

440
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:13,875
It was you who hit me

441
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:20,125
Find a way Chen Yue

442
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,000
Think of a way

443
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:26,666
I know what you're looking for

444
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,875
I can take you there.

445
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:34,791
But after that

446
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,000
Make sure we can leave safely

447
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,125
Get out of here. It's not safe

448
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,166
go

449
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:04,166
In-place adjustment

450
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:26,791
I'm sorry

451
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:32,125
There's no need to apologize

452
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:34,500
I decided to come by myself

453
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:37,291
I Know

454
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:39,666
You didn't come here for money

455
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:43,541
You're not just here to explore

456
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,041
Let's go Let's go

457
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:05,541
go

458
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:15,125
Be careful, everyone

459
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,625
Go, go

460
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:39,541
Go ashore

461
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:43,291
Be careful, fat person

462
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:45,041
look out

463
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,125
It's a killer bee

464
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:03,291
Run fast

465
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,291
Run fast

466
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,375
look out

467
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:22,166
go

468
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:33,875
jump

469
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:36,625
fast

470
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:40,625
go

471
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:43,791
he

472
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:48,291
Did they leave

473
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:50,666
gone

474
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:53,791
Then let's go

475
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:55,166
Let's go

476
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:02,541
Get stuck

477
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,000
What should I do?

478
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:11,541
You hold me

479
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:22,791
slow down

480
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:41,541
What to do, fat person

481
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:42,666
What should I do?

482
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,541
Don't be afraid of me

483
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,250
fat person

484
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:02,291
you

485
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:06,666
you

486
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:07,916
you

487
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:10,166
Pull flat

488
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:11,375
you

489
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:13,625
I rogue I rogue

490
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:00,500
Let's go

491
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:07,791
Let's go

492
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,291
Chen Yue

493
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:35,041
Zhong Ming

494
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:48,666
Zhong Ming

495
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,666
This pony

496
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,375
I have an identical one

497
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:38,416
My father made it for me when I was young

498
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,166
I was eight years old at that time

499
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:49,000
My father often plays with me

500
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,541
Tell me about paleontology

501
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:54,166
He told me

502
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:55,541
He said

503
00:39:56,041 --> 00:40:00,041
The earliest horse appeared 55 million years ago

504
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:03,000
At that time, it was only as big as a fox

505
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,166
Whales and hippos are relatives

506
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:09,166
They were 60 million years ago

507
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,750
We have a common ancestor

508
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,916
The snake originally had feet

509
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,166
It has experienced 100 million years of long evolution

510
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:22,791
He also told me

511
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:30,375
He said that humans and animals are the same

512
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:35,041
Parents will love their children

513
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,041
Children can't live without their parents

514
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,291
I really didn't understand when I was young

515
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:50,750
I didn't understand it until I grew up

516
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:54,875
They promised me

517
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:59,250
They said they would come back after their business trip

518
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,125
Help me finish this pony

519
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,375
And give me a whole zoo

520
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,750
But then I waited and waited

521
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:10,416
I didn't wait for my zoo

522
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16,791
I didn't even wait for them to come back

523
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:20,916
dad

524
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:22,041
Don't go

525
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:24,416
Don't leave me, Dad

526
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,666
Dad, I can't live without you

527
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:36,375
Ming

dad

530
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,416
dad

531
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:15,375
dad

532
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:19,750
Dad, did you have a hard time

533
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,791
no

534
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,416
dad

535
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:37,000
What a bitter drama that father and daughter recognize each other

536
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:38,916
copy from rolia

537
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,666
Professor Zhong

538
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:46,791
I'm Linchuan

539
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:49,916
Run fast

540
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:50,416
fat person

541
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:51,416
fast

542
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:56,916
Be careful

543
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,250
Be careful

544
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,166
here

545
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:47,000
Bai Xue

546
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:47,916
go

547
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:48,666
go

548
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:53,791
Bittersweet herb

549
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:56,500
water

550
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:00,666
not have

551
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,666
urine

552
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:39,416
Sixteen years

553
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:43,291
I didn't think you were alive, Professor Zhong

554
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:47,541
You know what I want

555
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:49,791
Take me there

556
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:51,375
How about taking me to find it

557
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,125
go

558
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:54,750
Let's go

559
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:59,000
I can't find that. How can I go

560
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:07,041
Sixteen years ago

561
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,916
We worked together to find that thing

562
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,166
Let's cooperate again this time

563
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:14,041
How about you find it for me

564
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:17,041
Will die

565
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:18,541
What to die

566
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:22,250
This island is full of my people

567
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:23,791
be dying

568
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:36,125
Let's go

569
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:38,291
Let's go

570
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,666
dad

571
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:56,041
Let them run

572
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,000
release a person

573
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:01,375
go

574
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,291
dad

575
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:22,375
go

576
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:41,666
snake

577
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:45,291
shoot

578
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:58,666
Let's go

579
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:18,250
Go, go

580
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:33,375
Don't come here

581
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,541
Why did you save him

582
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:41,041
go

583
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:43,000
go

584
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:57,625
dad

585
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,541
Why are we here

586
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:03,291
Why don't you go to Chen Yuexiahe and them

587
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:06,916
I

588
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:08,041
Regardless of

589
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:09,166
you

590
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,166
security

591
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:12,416
go

592
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:13,375
go

593
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,916
dad

594
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:15,125
dad

595
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:17,291
But they are still on the island

596
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:18,916
We came together

597
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,041
We must go together

598
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,875
dad

599
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,791
Where are we going

600
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,541
Not even in one direction

601
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:48,500
Yes, Brother Kang

602
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:50,000
here we go

603
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:52,416
I don't want to die here

604
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:55,375
Then you should find Boss Shen first

605
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:56,291
no

606
00:50:58,625 --> 00:50:59,791
Find yourself

607
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:01,000
I quit

608
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:03,541
Take all the money

609
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:05,250
Don't do it if you say no

610
00:51:05,916 --> 00:51:07,750
Don't do it if you say no

611
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,166
What's the matter

612
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:16,166
You say it again

613
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:36,041
Eat people's food and take their money

614
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:38,250
Do our job

615
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:40,916
Is to work for others

616
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:47,916
Your boss is your boss

617
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:49,750
My brother is my brother

618
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,625
Point a gun at me

619
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:53,166
But we can't refer to them

620
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:57,291
Keep going

621
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:12,291
No, no, no

622
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:13,041
Too tired

623
00:52:13,541 --> 00:52:14,166
gather breath

624
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:15,666
Take a break Take a break

625
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,166
Where are they Zhong Ming

626
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:29,791
Take it easy.

627
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:32,041
They've all escaped

628
00:52:34,291 --> 00:52:34,916
go

629
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:35,875
I'm not leaving

630
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:36,666
go

631
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:38,166
I'm so tired I won't leave

632
00:52:38,791 --> 00:52:39,416
such

633
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:41,416
You take me aboard

634
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:43,041
Go with me in my boat

635
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:46,166
I can also give you a sum of money

636
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,166
How much can you give

637
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:51,916
Your offer

638
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:53,750
What are you doing?

639
00:52:57,666 --> 00:52:58,416
You came here

640
00:52:59,041 --> 00:52:59,875
You come again

641
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:02,125
You came here

642
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:05,291
If you don't earn money, the devil will kill you

643
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,250
We have no boat now

644
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:09,291
Do we have to rely on him

645
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,500
Don't you take the money back and pay back the usury

646
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:14,166
But the bell is still on the island

647
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,000
We're going to save her

648
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:20,666
We

649
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:24,666
I have nothing to do with her We

650
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:28,291
You've only known each other for a few days

651
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:30,291
What you mean now is to

652
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:32,166
Save her regardless of my life or death

653
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:33,916
I don't care about you

654
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,750
When did I leave you alone

655
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:36,916
Don't do this with me

656
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:39,791
I don't know what you are thinking carefully

657
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:40,916
What is my mind

658
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:43,916
Dare you tell her why you went to the island

659
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:49,416
Don't you just because she looks Qian qian

660
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:52,291
Qian qian is dead

661
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:56,416
Was killed by selfish people like you

662
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:57,416
You say it again

663
00:53:57,416 --> 00:53:57,875
What's wrong?

664
00:53:58,750 --> 00:53:59,541
Hit me

665
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:01,041
what do you mean

666
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:03,291
Now is it for that woman to beat me

667
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:05,041
You don't even want a brother

668
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:06,666
I don't want brothers

669
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:09,000
Who doesn't want his brother for money

670
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,916
Do I need money that much

671
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:18,125
Think about who I am doing this for

672
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:43,625
Get out of my way

673
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:49,625
fat person

674
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,750
Your health has been bad

675
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:57,541
Let's go back first

676
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:04,291
Let me accompany you through the last section of the road

677
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:20,166
Qian qian

678
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:22,166
I'm back again

679
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:25,250
Unexpectedly, on this island

680
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,041
There are so many secrets we don't know

681
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:30,250
I miss you so much

682
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:33,416
I think so much

683
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:04,541
After you leave

684
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,791
I don't even know what it means to live

685
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,416
I've never been to risk again

686
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,041
Even photography has given up

687
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:18,250
I don't even know why I'm alive

688
00:56:24,416 --> 00:56:25,291
the other day

689
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:29,166
I met a girl

690
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,166
She looks like you

691
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:37,041
I don't know if you gave me another chance

692
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:39,875
Right?

693
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:49,625
Am I too selfish

694
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,166
Maybe the fat man is right

695
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,125
I am a selfish person

696
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:02,416
I'm sorry

697
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:05,291
Forgive me

698
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:25,916
It wasn't me

699
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:30,000
Help!

700
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,375
Come on

701
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:49,625
Chen Yue

702
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:51,041
Zhong Ming

703
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,916
